  <h3>this is what internet says about my breed</h3>
  <div class="intro">
    <p class="unimportant">Border Terriers are good-natured dogs and can make great companions.  Originally bred to aid in fox hunts, the Border Terrier would drive the fox out of his den and into the open where the hounds would chase him down. The Border Terrier is believed to be one of Britainâ€™s oldest Terrier breeds.  The Border Terrier is a high energy dog, who has a strong drive to dig and hunt <em>(and wreck things)</em>. Therefore, they do best with an active family that can provide plenty of fun activities. <em>(My owner is boring as hell so I have to entertain myself.)</em> This energetic canine has a harsh coat which should be brushed on a weekly basis, but I am unique, my coat was once soft and fluffy. Now it is mangy and patchy and almost entirely gone.</p>

    <p>my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-destructive_art">transformative work</a> is important to me. I like to chew on paper, and find it very therapeutic. Tearing and shredding are 2 of my favorite activities. Toilet paper is nice but art and paychecks are a lot more fun.</p>
